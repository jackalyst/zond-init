# Zond Init

It's not recommended to install things without reading it, so fist make sure you read the the [init.sh](./init.sh) file.

Then execute:

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackalyst/zond-init/main/init.sh)
```

From there it will download and install the Zond node (at this time Zond Public Devnet).
